# Roney_CSCI2270_FinalProject-
Project Summary:
For this project, I am going to create a hashtable (specifically an array of linked lists) of books that became movies (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, ect.).  The tree will consist of book structs with a title, best character, character rating, book rating, movie rating, and overall rating (scale of 1-10).  The overall ranking will be calculated based on the book, movie, and best character rating.  
At the start of the program, a list of 50 books that became movies will be displayed along with a menu option.  The user will have the option to add different rankings based on what books or movies they have read.  Once the user puts in their rankings, they can select the option to display (in order) the top books, top movies, top characters, and top overall books that became movies.  If the user did not add rankings to any movie, those rankings will not be displayed.

# Roney_CSCI2270_FinalProject-
Project Summary:
For this project, I am going to create a red-black tree of books that became movies (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, ect.).  The tree will consist of book structs with a title, best character, bool readBook, bool seenMovie, and an ID that is a vector of rankings of the book, movie, best character, and overall ranking (scale of 1-10).  The overall ranking will be calculated based on the book, movie, and best character ranking.  
At the start of the program, a list of 50 books that became movies will be displayed along with a menu option.  The user will have the option to add different rankings based on what books or movies they have read.  Once the user puts in their rankings, they can select the option to display (in order) the top books, top movies, top characters, and top overall books that became movies.  If the user did not read the books or see the movies, those rankings will not be displayed.
